# Problem Statement :

Build For Small Businesses: A solution that is built for use by small businesses and solves a real problem with a valid use

## Our approach:

We have tried to tackle this problem by making a tourism and local handicrafts centric e-commerce website that would enable local craftsmen and small businesses to sell their goods online to the customers anywhere on the globe.

## DESCRIPTION :

Local craftsmen and artisans depend on the tourism industry for their livelihood. Their main income is when the influx of tourists is at its peak. But once the peak rush is over, they have to sit in hopes for their goods to sell and their income reduces significantly posing a threat to their survival.
On top of that, the present COVID-19 pandemic has affected the travel & tourism industry for the worst. Restrictions have been imposed on international as well as domestic travelling. Many tourist spots have closed down.
This has had a direct affect on local small businesses attached to the tourist spots as there is no one to buy their goods physically.
To get over this problem, our solution would enable them to sell their goods directly to the customer through our e-commerce website. This would ensure their income doesn’t diminish in scenarios like the current one.

## How does our site work ?

1. The user visits the landing page and is presented by a state wise menu consisting of the famous places to visit in that state and their renowned local handicraft and handloom products.

2. By clicking on the tourism spot’s card, the user is directed to a page dedicated solely to that spot containing all the information like historic facts etc, along with picture. This provides an informative experience to the user.

3. By clicking on the good’s card, the user is redirected to the product’s page and is shown information and options like materials used, sizes available, colors available, quantity selection, Add to cart feature etc like on any other e-commerce website.

4. The user can also go the CART tab at the top to check out the items in the cart and proceed to payment.

5. After placing an order, the operations team, in the backend, would ensure that the products are bought from the small vendors of the desired location only.

6. This would not only provide a boost to their income, but also give exposure to their work on a global platform. Employment opportunities will also be created in such small towns as he logistics team would need delivery staff to buy the goods form the local vendor and send it to the company’s warehouse for further dispatchement.

## Tech Stack:

1. Frontend:

   a. HTML

   b. CSS

   c. JavaScript

   d. ReactJs

2. Backend

   a. NodeJs

   b. ExpressJs

3. API (for payment)

   a. Razorpay Payments API

## Future Scope:

1. Collaborations can be made with the state’s government to provide various schemes and packages through the website that would help in the exposure and growth of the tourism industry.

2. In hard times, like the present covid scenario, customers can be provided with an option while checking out to payment, whether they would like to donate some extra tip for the local vendor and the delivery staff.
